This has sometimes happened implicitly and there is a lack of systematic analysis of how concepts and theories of political philosophy have been used to build arguments for particular policy applications in bioethics, and whether this has happened in a consistent way. 

The Emmy Noether Research Groups looks across a number of issues and discussions in bioethics and examines how political philosophy has played out in these areas. Based on this horizontal analysis, it seeks to develop well-argued policy proposals for ongoing bioethical debates. Exemplary fields of inquiry are theories of justice and priority setting in medicine and health care; the different normative justifications of public health and health promotion policies; concepts of the person and enhancement; and solidarity in contemporary bioethical applications.

I'm a General Partner in Earlybird’s Munich Office and I focus on Enterprise Software with a particular interest in AI, infrastructure, data/developer/design tools, OSS, and robotics. Before transitioning into VC in 2017, I gained more than 5 years of experience as a process automation and predictive maintenance engineer at ThyssenKrupp and further insights as a management consultant at GE North America. 

I conducted my Ph.D. at the Technical University of Munich on the topic of ""Machine learning and the value of data in venture capital"". Moreover, I hold a M.Sc. in Management and a B.Eng. in Mechatronics Engineering and was previously educated at Harvard University, University of Cambridge, and Georgia Institute of Technology, among others.","SxhDKfAdS3WdqV5q1GrNZw==",,"Federal Ministry for Economics and Climate Action",,"Advisory Board Member","7","2022","8","2021",,"TUM Business Game",,"Co-Founder","5","2017","4","2016",,"TUM Business Club e.V",,"President","12","2016","1","2016"

We are a team of pioneering computer architects, computer scientists, deep learning researchers, and engineers of all types. We have come together to build a new class of computer to accelerate artificial intelligence work by three orders of magnitude beyond the current state of the art. Our flagship product, the CS-3,  is the fastest AI computer in existence. It contains a collection of industry firsts, including the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine (WSE-3). The WSE-3 is the largest chip ever built. It contains 4 trillion transistors and covers more than 46,225 square millimeters of silicon. The largest competitor's processor is only 80 billion transistors and covers 815 square millimeters. In artificial intelligence work, large chips process information more quickly producing answers in less time. As a result, neural networks that in the past took months to train, can now train in minutes and models that take tens of seconds to serve can be served immediately. 

Prior to co-founding Cerebras Systems, I was co-founder and CEO of SeaMicro.  SeaMicro (acquired by AMD for $355 million) was the pioneer in low power server technology. SeaMicro changed the trajectory of the server industry by inventing the high density, lower power, microserver category.

Prior to co-founding SeaMicro, I was Vice President of Marketing and Product Management at Force10 (acquired by Dell for $800 Million) Networks, and Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Corporate Development for Riverstone Networks (NASDAQ: RSTN) from inception through IPO. 

My passion is building teams that solve hard problems. Together we recognize large emerging opportunities, listen closely to customer requirements, build industry transforming products, and then bring these products to market in compelling fashion.","t306K1m/R0ScwPuCukinWQ==",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He has worked as a 3D Designer, Art Director, Creative Director, 3D Director and mentor - helping 3D artists hone the skills they need to become masters of their craft. He spent the first part of his career in advertising and title design for film and television working on numerous award winning campaigns for Honda, Microsoft, Autodesk, HBO, Showtime, Verizon, Sprint, NASCAR, Nickelodeon, and more. Early on, his ability to conjure unique and amazingly detailed 3D worlds elevated him as pioneer in the newly developing field of motion graphics and 3D design. 

In 2013, Dade joined TurboSquid to help build and curate the world’s largest 3D content library and to bring 3D models to an even wider audience of non-3D users. Since then, his focus has been to simplify the overtly technical challenges facing 3D artists by developing standards, tools, and training that allow artists to focus more on the creative side of 3D content creation. With a deep understanding of industry trends and tools that are driving 3D processes, he continues to work with many of the biggest names in the 3D space to assure that 3D content adheres to the latest industry requirements and workflows. 

Now at Shutterstock, his vision for feeding content to the Metaverse gains even greater focus as he looks toward harnessing AI and ML technologies to help 3D content creators build, conform, manage, and distribute their 3D content. It’s not enough to simply make great looking 3D models, 3D artists need build 3D content that is truly flexible enough to work in all the new and amazing platforms being developed… as well as applications far into the future. Right now is the most amazing time to be in the 3D content creation game, and it’s getting even more exciting every day.","New Orleans, Louisiana, United States","6","2024","3","2021","Vice President of 3D Innovation","true","urn:li:fsd_company:261478","200","51","urn:li:fs_miniCompany:261478","Internet","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E0BAQFCVzJxIWY5zw/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1631311107674?e=1746662400&v=beta&t=qUGcOfdOhGG7jRL21eDhHT9PPbEdaTS-WgVgr-WfLBY","TurboSquid by Shutterstock","urn:li:company:261478","false","ULpA6ie8QG6asLTwtHF+Uw==","turbosquid","TurboSquid",,"Greater New Orleans Area","8","2021","11","2018","Chief Creative Officer","false","urn:li:fsd_company:6420509","50","11","urn:li:fs_miniCompany:6420509","Design","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQHu0czFtPWxqA/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1631307418592?e=1746662400&v=beta&t=l9e6SjacP3CjyYKSvssq8UGjqvwc67iufVNwfT8sKQg","PixelSquid","urn:li:company:6420509","false","rI7PEnyORcaMO5Otr46LxQ==","pixelsquid","PixelSquid","PixelSquid.com is geared specifically for expert level graphic designers.

We believe that, for many of these phases, we can develop machine learning models to help predict the outcome of these experiments, and that those models, while inevitably imperfect, will outperform predictions based on traditional heuristics. The key will be to train powerful ML techniques on sufficient amounts of high-quality, relevant data. To achieve this goal, we are building a diverse team that spans multiple disciplines within the life science and machine learning. We bring together cutting edge methods in functional genomics and lab automation to build a bio-data factory that can produce relevant biological data at scale, allowing us to create large, high-quality datasets that enable the development of novel ML models.

The reason for that is twofold: not enough high-quality, relevant data; and not enough ""bilingual"" people who understand both domains and are able to identify the important problems and design the ""right"" solutions. At insitro, we aim to address both these challenges, and help address an important societal problem: design novel, safe, and effective therapies that help more people, faster, and at a lower cost. We have many exciting and challenging problems, and are building a diverse team of exceptionally talented people. Please join us!

Today, 200M businesses each month turn to Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to connect with billions of consumers around the world. Meta’s Llama models have over 600M downloads to date, and Meta AI has more than 500M monthly actives. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology.","San Francisco, California, United States",,,"11","2024","VP, Head of Business AI","true","urn:li:fsd_company:88007673","50","11","urn:li:fs_miniCompany:88007673","Computer Software","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQFNCoFCub_8sw/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1698290900915/perplexity_ai_logo?e=1746662400&v=beta&t=2AzMGP_0xDOkCVis9K1a_KMcBXR6AS6EFtdEun3azHY","Perplexity","urn:li:company:88007673","false","rpNfm0fvTlqkMMVNJ09pQg==","perplexity-ai","Perplexity","Early stage investor and advisor to startups including Perplexity, Lakera, Bardeen, Qodo (Codium), Color, Ethos Life, and Gusto",,,,,"2013","Advisor & Investor","true","urn:li:fsd_company:3129360","200","51","urn:li:fs_miniCompany:3129360","Primary/Secondary Education","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQHX0AzJO3CpDw/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1736982271391/code_org_logo?e=1746662400&v=beta&t=e6lQrwJ6i5nSZT-mJKT3RpkCB6Dd4j3cl4HVM1eScQA","Code.org","urn:li:company:3129360","false","90OlwyN7T3GLv2pXdL1nbw==","code-org","Code.org",,,,,,"2015","Diversity Advisory Council","true","urn:li:fsd_company:3185",,"10001","urn:li:fs_miniCompany:3185","Computer Software","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQHZ9xYomLW7zg/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1630658255326/salesforce_logo?e=1746662400&v=beta&t=K69poZZtfbf5wsnWQtqTV3njBHmbHwckTinJS0qS99k","Salesforce","urn:li:company:3185","false","6Phjx2FnSnmxW1H6/NrwJg==","salesforce","Salesforce","Led AI efforts across Salesforce, including product, applied research (frontier team), domain-specific model development, go-to-market, revenue, adoption, partnerships, acquisitions, and responsible AI. The four years I spent as a boomerang at Salesforce have been some of the most rewarding in my career.  The organization we built, execution speed, and customer and revenue impact of the generative AI platform we developed from prototype to GA product were unmatched. 

It all started in 2022 with 'Gucci GPT'-- an LLM application prototype we developed with Salesforce Research when I was leading Service Cloud, to suggest accurate, on-brand responses to customer service inquiries. We moved at startup speed and rapidly built a prototype that cut support resolution times while increasing NPS and commerce revenue. When ChatGPT captured the world's imagination that November, we were ready with our learnings and shipped 'Einstein GPT for Service and Sales' just a few months later. I was asked to take on a new role to build out an AI platform and organization to support sales, marketing, commerce, and 3p developer use cases beyond Service Cloud. 

Our team built the Einstein AI Trust Layer (prompt injection defense, toxicity filters, observability and monitoring), Prompt Builder, Model Builder (to support 3p models including Llama and OpenAI, and finetuning), Advanced RAG, and Agentforce Studio, shipping at incredible speed to get to product-market fit. We had to invent new methods to upskill our 11,000 salespeople and broader ecosystem. We started an applied research incubation team in partnership with Salesforce Research, called Frontier/Atlas, for rapid experimentation that has delivered Generative Canvas UX, LLM Benchmarks for CRM, and Atlas reasoning engine, to ensure an ongoing cadence of organic innovation. The company went through a difficult period in 2022, and these efforts helped re-energize the entire organization and ecosystem.","San Francisco Bay Area","11","2024","3","2023","CEO, Salesforce AI","true","urn:li:fsd_company:1695382","500","201","urn:li:fs_miniCompany:1695382","Financial Services","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQG4Le_upfM1WA/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1722545382144/hearsay_systems_logo?e=1746662400&v=beta&t=Os-JiLcRDEAYglYSbRx2GoPRjnKksE8FqaglT8S1Mf8","Hearsay Systems","urn:li:company:1695382","false","P9+WWihtQK6zNfjKS0xuGQ==","hearsay-systems","Hearsay Systems","Starting and scaling a company from 'zero to one' was one of the best, hardest experiences I've ever had.

Wieso darf der sich Mr. Transformation nennen? 
Eine berechtigte Frage und vielleicht hattest du im ersten Augenblick sogar ein Störgefühl. 

Ich könnte jetzt hier eine ganze Tapete schreiben, warum ich mich dort sehe. Hier kommt eine gute Idee: Stell mir deine wichtigste oder schwierigste Frage zu Transformation. Egal ob deine persönliche, die eines Teams oder gar eine ganze Organisation.

😎☀️👍🏼 Du investierst also 1 Minute und bekommst eine wirklich hilfreiche Antwort - versprochen.


Nun zu Transformation...

3 Faktoren zählen...
... TransformationsBEREITSCHAFT
... TransformationsFÄHIGKEIT
... TransformatinonsGESCHWINDIGKEIT

Das nachhaltig aufzubauen ist meine Kernkompetenz!

➡️ 3 Kernfragen
❓Was ermöglicht persönliche Veränderung?
❓Wie wird Transformation für Unternehmen ein Wettbewerbsvorteil?
❓Wie verlassen wir Ohnmacht, Frust und Stress hinzu Schöpferkraft mit Sinn und Leichtigkeit?

➡️ Alle Ergebnisse sind menschengemacht und somit immer eine Folge des Denkens. Das Denken ist eine Folge der inneren Haltung. Und daraus entstehen Handlung und Resultate.

✅ Somit gilt: Wer andere Ergebnisse möchte, braucht eine andere Haltung. 

🚀 Leicht gesagt, oder? Ich zeige machbare Wege für Menschen und Organisationen auf.

Bei mir findest du zahlreiche Antworten dazu. Keine blaue Pille (Matrix), dafür viele praxiserprobte Ansätze, die auch du für dich, dein Team oder dein Unternehmen einsetzen kannst.

He did his Ph.D. at ETH Zurich, a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a visiting professor at Stanford University. His research focuses on autonomous, agile navigation of mini drones using standard and event-based cameras. He pioneered autonomous, vision-based navigation of drones, which inspired the navigation algorithm of the NASA Mars helicopter and many drone companies. In 2022, his team demonstrated that an AI-powered drone could outperform the world champion of drone racing, a result published in Nature. He has been consulting the United Nations on disaster response, the Fukushima Action Plan, disarmament, and AI for good. For his research contributions, he has won many awards, including the very recent IEEE Kiyo Tomiyasu Technical Field Award, the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society Early Career Award, a European Research Council Consolidator Grant, and many paper awards, including the IROS 2023 Best Paper Award, the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters' and Transactions on Robotics best paper awards, and a 2023 CVPR Best Paper Award finalist. Davide contributed significantly to visual-inertial state estimation, vision-based agile navigation of microdrones, and low-latency, robust perception with event cameras. His results have been transferred to many products, from drones to automobiles, cameras, AR/VR headsets, and mobile devices. Davide counts several entrepreneurial achievements: in 2015, he co-founded Zurich-Eye, which became Meta Zurich, which developed the world-leading virtual-reality headset Meta Quest. In 2020, he co-founded SUIND, which builds autonomous drones for precision agriculture. Many aspects of his research have been featured in the media, such as The New York Times, The Economist, and Forbes.","Sk5oVXdRQ+6WU03jMip6gg==",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He holds NCARB certification and is a LEED Accredited Professional.  Along with Tricia Stuth, he is a partner and co-founder of the firm curb, which is devoted to creating architecture that is well-designed, sustainable, and intimately tied to its place. They were winners of both the Plan Section Sentence Competition and the HOME House Competition and semifinalists in the Kielder Observatory Competition sponsored by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). Their work has been recognized with merit awards from AIA East Tennessee, AIA Tennessee, and AIA Gulf States Region and been published in ARCADE: Journal of Northwest Architecture and Design, the Journal of Architectural Education, and HOME House: the Future of Affordable Housing.

Prof. Shelton is also a partner in Applied Research - a collaborative design team of University of Tennessee faculty members from the College of Architecture and Design. Combining the research interests of four faculty members, the group advances an architectural discourse by focusing on several key areas that include green design, material and construction technology, adaptive reuse, urban and community development, and spatial poetics. Applied Research was a finalist in the Jefferson Heights Tomorrow Sustainable Housing Competition for the design of environmentally progressive infill housing in Chattanooga, TN.

Over the past 17 years, I have worked on the design, evaluation, and improvement of a number of adaptive learning systems for learners, from 3-year-olds to professionals, for learning math, science, reading, medical science, and more.

I have also worked on assessments of 21st century competencies, curriculum design for project-based learning with VR, and learning design for a college experiential learning program. 

I think great learning experiences come about when we put the learners first, engineer for evidence, and learn as we go. And we do it together in interdisciplinary teams. 

My work is often a blend of cognitive psychology, learning analytics, efficacy research, psychometrics, and partnerships (I can't do it all myself!). You can find me translating research to learning product design and strategy, leading efficacy studies, pulling insights from learning analytics to inform product design and improvements, creating and validating assessments, establishing and maintaining partnerships with various organizations and consultants. I enjoy every aspect!

I also enjoy sharing what I've learned. Some of my recent publications:
- The Handbook of Research on Innovative Approaches to Early Childhood Development and School Readiness: https://www.igi-global.com/book/handbook-research-innovative-approaches-early/272193. 
- A couple chapters on human-centered design and data analytics in the Learning Engineering Toolkit: https://www.routledge.com/Learning-Engineering-Toolkit-Evidence-Based-Practices-from-the-Learning/Goodell-Kolodner/p/book/9781032232829

My journey has taken me from being a researcher in mathematical physics to a lead data scientist, and more recently, I’ve added the role of professor of mathematics to my career.

At heart, I’m a scientist driven by curiosity. My current research and professional interests include:

- Mathematical statistics and geometric data analysis
- Visualizing networks and interpreting high-dimensional data
- Exploring applications of large language models (LLMs), with a focus on embeddings and semantic search
- Teaching and mentoring in mathematics and statistics

In the past, I’ve explored topics such as:

- Mathematical relativity and Lorentzian geometry
- Simulating pedestrian flows in complex environments
- Image processing

I love working on interdisciplinary problems, blending theory with practical approaches to push boundaries—whether in academia, industry, or anywhere in between.","nOrd+dp4TWOEq5XRB4no6w==",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are now on a mission to bring the AI Campus to a global scale.

3) I’m a strong advocate of pushing AI in Europe: therefore I co-founded and co-lead the German AI association (KI Bundesverband e.V.) representing the majority of Germany’s AI startups, and work closely with the German government on their AI strategy and implementation.

My experience around the globe has equipped me with the skills to interpret complex datasets, identify patterns, and derive insights that inform meaningful policy decisions and health initiatives.

Currently, I am expanding my expertise by training in data science, where I'm honing my skills in programming, python, advanced statistical methods, and machine learning. I am particularly drawn to how data-driven approaches can solve real-world problems and contribute to improved health outcomes.
I am eager to leverage my analytical background and new data science skills in a dynamic role where I can contribute to innovative projects and collaborate with diverse teams. I believe in the power of data to drive change and look forward to exploring opportunities within the data science field.

I want to leverage four decades of leadership, mentoring, media communication & caregiving to promote healing from emotional & spiritual dysfunction, which comes through discovering one's true identity in Jesus. I pursue through ""high tech & high touch,"" facilitating connectivity through in-person dialog, social media tools, blogs & digital books for the online community, marketplace & classroom. 

   As a chaplain I served 10 law enforcement agencies in California, ministering to people in crisis & distress. As a pastor I made it a top priority to mentor leaders, young & old. Our team of elders transitioned into becoming the assistant executives of the church, overseeing all outreach & nurture activities. Forty-three ministries flourished. My strategy was to empower the elders while establishing with them an accountability system including mentoring & discipling.

   My leadership philosophy is rooted in mutual respect & trust. I help each individual identify their ministry passion & unique giftedness to become activated in the Spirit as a team. In counsel with the head of our organization, I gather the ministry group for strategic planning, generating goals that are both measurable & attainable. Then we develop action plans that are assigned with accountability & mentoring. The team is totally energized to fulfill a shared vision & implement the mission, transcending minimum job requirements.

  I monitor the progress of my staff and their outcome--but do not micromanage their process. I accept my own responsibility for the progress of my department, accountable ultimately to the head of our organization.

Specialties: Leadership by facilitating collaboration, writing, speaking, conflict resolution. Have written (or ""ghost"" written) 20 books, most recently ""God Was There: true stories of a police chaplain.""","0ZIrCKLjR9WjkJ6LLHFuGA==",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I host the nation's largest weekend radio show that happens to be about living in today's digital world. The focus of my show is not political. I only speak of consumer electronics, what's happening or trending on the Internet, smartphones, online security, and more that makes up our digital lifestyle.

Other quick fun facts about the show: 

• Aside from the 400 stations here in the USA, the Kim Komando show is also broadcast internationally on the American Forces Radio Network. This consists of 177 different countries and every ship at sea.

• The Kim Komando Show web site (http://www.komando.com) receives 16 million page views and 3.9 million uniques per month.

• We deliver more than 12 million opt-in email newsletters each week.

• Advertisers include Carbonite, GoDaddy, SimpliSafe and more.

Every week, my team produces 150 pieces of exclusive web content that drives traffic, daily radio content, a weekly HD television show that is a reality peek into the national radio show, and two separate weekly columns carried by USA Today and FoxNews.

BUT I only allow top brands in front of my audience. We have grown some of the biggest audio players with the use of technology and analytics plus creative. We’re now in our 20th year. It works!

After a couple of years as Head of the Nordic Site Management & Monitoring team I am now Global Head of Site partnerships and engagement at AstraZeneca.

My leadership is defined by trust, clear expectations and empowerment. I have built effective and organised teams where the individual grow to increased independence and contribution to the organisation. I have experience from change management, building a growing organisation, CRO contracting and oversight management and implementing strategies and processes. I’m experienced with all aspects of clinical trials from phase I to IV in various therapeutic areas from my work in the CRO business and the more recent clinical development consultancy.

I joined the pharmaceutical business in 2003 and held positions of increasing responsibility within the CRO business, before I joined Schering-Plough in 2005 as Medical Affairs Project Manager. 

From 2006 I managed the Clinical Quality and Compliance team at Schering-Plough Sweden where I collaborated with the regional team in Europe. 

From 2008 I was Manager Clinical Operations in Sweden where I participated in several global teams. I was a member of the local clinical operations leadership team. This was during integration between Schering-Plough and MSD.

From 2011 I was Manager Clinical Operations in Sweden at the Nordic CRO NORMA A/S. I was a member of the Nordic clinical operations leadership team as head of a constantly growing team of associates.

From May 2014 I was managing the Clinical Project Management team at the drug development company SDS. This was a combined role as Director and Senior Advisor Clinical Development in a fast growing company.

From October 2018 I am heading the Nordic Site Management & Monitoring organisation at AstraZeneca, responsible for delivery of AZs clinical trials in the Nordic region.","L28k8bmWSB6626nh1x7SHg==",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In my teaching, I am passionate about sharing HR knowledge from the perspective of individual managers to show how HR is an integral part of every manager's job (and leadership), not just a central function far removed from the core business. I also enjoy teaching leadership to professionals (e.g. EMBA students), focusing in particular on the changing leadership role expectations and how to deal with them.","NFdYICOQRZuicenG4tFGnQ==",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But the Soviet Union-born, New Jersey-bred marketing guru can also point to results, starting with WineLibrary.com, the e-commerce site he launched for his parents’ wine shop in 1996, before he even owned a computer. “I understood people were going to buy wine on the Internet,” said Mr. Vaynerchuk, who eventually increased the store’s overall sales to more than $50 million from $3 million.

Meanwhile, VaynerMedia, the social-marketing agency he founded in 2009, and which counts Pepsi and General Electric among its clients, is set to top $50 million in revenue this year.""

But he is largely unknown to the American television-viewing public. Rather, he is Internet famous. That fame happened by design and by years of meticulous planning—and it has drawn vocal critics for a style that is loud, bombastic and blatantly self-promotional. (A sample exhortation from a video commanding people to subscribe to his YouTube channel: 'Fucking follow me, right now.')""

A small and kinetic man with dark hair that is starting to gray, he speaks with a warm, raspy voice, as though he’s been talking all day, which he usually has. He is funny and profane and gesticulates constantly, putting air quotes around phrases that he merely wants to emphasize. Among this favorite subjects are the New York Jets, which he has vowed to buy, and his own talents, which amaze even him.

“I have as big of an ego as it gets,” he said during a recent interview, in a tone suggesting that he was simply stating the facts, “but I have, stunningly, a lot of humility considering some of the accomplishments I’ve had.”

These accomplishments include the building of VaynerMedia, which opened in 2009 and now has 290 employees, serving clients as mainstream as Del Monte, General Electric and PepsiCo. They come in the hope that Mr. Vaynerchuk can do for them what he has already done for himself: build an online audience through pluck, ubiquity and charm.""

He is a prolific angel investor with early investments in companies like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Venmo, Snapchat, Coinbase, and Uber.

From pacemakers that help a weak heart beat stronger to surgeries that prevent palpitations, what I find most rewarding about my specialty is the long-term, life-altering, positive effects patients experience after undergoing an EP procedure.  Everything I do is designed to allow patients to live a normal life.  I often focus on the fact that each patient presents with a different set of symptoms and medical history and I understand that patients may initially be frightened by the prospect of undergoing an EP procedure.  But, I take great pride in the relationships I have established and always take the time to explain the complex workings of the heart and the intervention I feel would be most appropriate in straight-forward language, oftentimes even creating drawings to assist in communicating.  

My practice at St. Catherine’s of Siena Medical Center is unique in that it offers a small office feel with the level of care of a major medical center.  Through close relationships with every major hospital in the area, including St. Francis Hospital, I am able to offer my patients treatments that utilize the newest technology and advancements in the field of EP.  But this does not change the fact that when patients arrive at the office they are greeted by Barbara, and when they call for help on the weekend they get the only doctor ever on call: me.

I have also taken a sincere interest in the problem of physician alignment and how it can be improved with technology. This interest had led to the development of the DirectLineMD app which you can learn more about on my webpage (www.directlinemd.com) or by contacting me directly.","ImQSn2rmRreLVKhiVR8rmg==",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have three years of Teaching Assistant experience and three years of Research Assistant experience. My teaching and research experiences have given me a specialty in Geochemistry, Mineralogy, and Petrology, while my course-work has provided me familiarity with Environmental and Economic Geology. 

As a Master's student, I modeled the formation conditions of plagioclase corona round garnets, a common metamorphic texture in orogenic regions. Through petrographic, SEM-BSE, and EMPA analysis, geothermobarometric calculations, and thermodynamic modeling, I determined that the plagioclase-corona-resorbed-garnet texture is the result of partial melting from regional uplift.

As a Ph.D. student, I used ICP-MS and ICP-OES analysis to chemically characterize the produced waters of the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale of Mississippi and Louisiana and published the results in Applied Geochemistry. Our findings concluded that dissolved solids in the produced waters are dominantly the result of hydrofracking fluids mixing with formation waters, most likely Louann Salt bitterns. We also determined that the concentration of some trace elements had loose correlations to the organic complexes of the hydrocarbon system (Cu and V). In contrast, others (Zn and Pb) may be more closely linked to metal availability and redox conditions of specific geologic units.

My dissertation (in progress) looks at the water-rock interactions during hydrofracturing in clay-rich (shale) host rocks and how variations in initial 'frack fluid' pH, salinity, and chemical composition affect these reactions. Experiments and analysis include batch reactions to determine mineral reaction rates through ICP-MS and ICP-OES analysis and observation of physical changes to porosity and permeability through photomicrographs and EDS elemental mapping. To date, we interpret the dominant reactions are carbonate dissolution and cation exchange between clays and organics with saline solutions. Secondary reactions are silicate dissolution and precipitation, sulfide oxidation and oxide precipitation, and sulfate precipitation. The porosity of the shales exhibits minor increases with carbonate dissolution, but permeability is unlikely to increase due to the isolated nature of the carbonate grains. Only when the experimental solution composition approximates formation water composition is there no change to porosity.","GTAi11u1TP247g0CMC7o+w==","HEALTH","United Blood Services",,"Blood Donor","8","2018",,"2010","ANIMAL_RIGHTS","Nevada Humane Society","Walked and socialized shelter dogs at the shelter and at offsite events.","Volunteer Dog Walker/ Event Volunteer","3","2012","10","2009","HEALTH","Relay For Life","Raised money and walked with other team members on Relay Night.","Team Member","4","2007","11","2003"

I am a researcher in the area of Human-Computer Interaction, with a keen focus on Affective Computing. Currently, I am part of the Affective Computing Group, focusing on applications to support mental health.

My academic journey began in industrial and organizational psychology, studying job applications. Combining my expertise in psychology with cutting-edge technology, my research centers now around exploring how we can support humans by preparing them for stressful situations with the help of Socially Interactive Agents.

By bridging the gap between psychology and AI, I aspire to revolutionize the way we interact with technology. My ultimate vision is to empower machines with emotional intelligence, creating a world where technology is not only perceptive but empathetic too.

After graduating from high school, I started studying business administration in Berlin, but realized that Psychology is my subject.

Accordingly I started studying psychology at Radboud University in Nijmegen in the Netherlands and graduated with a master's in clinical psychology.
After graduating, I started as a doctoral candidate at the University of Duisburg-Essen, where I did research in the field of teaching- and learning-psychology and did my doctorate. 
Afterwards I worked at reflact AG as a project manager and customer advisor. The focus was on didactics as well as on teaching- and learning- psychological design within digital learning environments.

Now I am working as a freelance consultant in the field of HR consulting as well as a fashion and style coaching. 

One of my main customer is a long-established HR consultancy in Düsseldorf, Personalberatung Dr. Vossen, that is specialized in carrying out talent analysis on young people, who usually come after they graduate from school, in order to be able to objectively point out their strengths. This makes it easier for clients to find a suitable study subject or a suitable job.
 
In addition, I was trained as a fashion stylist at the Academy for Fashion and Design (Düsseldorf) in 2015 and took further training in fashion psychology at Radboud University. In this area I also advise, mostly private clients. Based on psychological analysis and consideration of the client's professional, family and other relevant situations and roles, I create a fashion style concept. Here the focus is on the client's authenticity and wellbeing. In some cases, the advice extends to other areas of life. Then I additionally advise (psychologically based) on furnishings and interior design.","ygOqtgnAQ5ynp66cmFtCNQ==",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the applied side, I care about ""AI for social good"" -- currently I am looking at applications in healthcare. I am also interested in energy, education, nutrition, agriculture, and other areas where data driven thinking holds great promise.

I'm at my best when faced with a pivot, a new technology, or transitioning great teams to what comes next. 

In my previous role as head of the Next Generation team at The Washington Post, we launched The 7 podcast, Style Sessions and a new team of political reporters who publish social-first. Before that, I was deputy director of video. I oversaw our daily and breaking news team and helped launch the Visual Forensics unit. Name a video format or platform, and I probably helped lead our experimentation! 

I've also had the chance to work closely with our product team as the newsroom product owner for video, where I helped build the technology stack that became part of Arc XP.

I love it! As a studied Mechanical Engineer, I´ve never believed to become a Technology Strategist at one of the leading technology companies on the planet. But Digital Transformation fascinated me throughout my professional career. In the early years, I replaced drawing boards with CAD on PC´s, Paper-based lists with Databases and helped to bring a PC on every desk. After constant changes in the Tech-Industry, we´re now extending human ingenuity with Artificial Intelligence, and create a new world of Mobility in the Automotive Industry.
The passion for Automotive was one of the stable anchors in my career, and with this, I´m proud to serve Daimler globally.
In my spare time, I love to play Drums & Percussion. And also here, Change is the constant. Starting  in a Rock-Band, I play now in a Brass Orchestra together with 7 other Drummers, and in small Big Band (can something Big be small?). Playing Drumset, Mallets & Percussion is so inspiring, relaxing and pure joy. Since beginning of 2019, I play again in a Rock Band called ""Charly Brown´s Parents""( https://charly-browns-parents.chayns.net/ )!
Most important is the family life. We can talk about when we met several times ;-)

Do you like to discuss how technology can change your role or business at Daimler? Get in contact with me and have a chat.

These accomplishments are not simply at the center of Caster Connection, the company she founded in 1987; rather. they are also at the core of who Sally is as a person: passion, integrity, determination, persistence, and a commitment to superiority. It is no wonder Sally has become a trusted industry leader in the production, manufacturing, and distribution of casters.

★    ★    ★ 

Now leading a multimillion-dollar company with 35+ employees, a thriving full-scale warehouse in accessible Columbus, Ohio, and partnerships with thousands of clients across the world, Sally is a dogged visionary with a long reputation for delivering superior products. Her success rests in her willingness to invite team members, clients, buyers, and consumers into the troubleshooting and product development process, guaranteeing that the casters and wheels that Caster Collection offers are reliable, tested, dependable, and the best fit to meet specific market needs.

★    ★    ★ 

Sally’s lifetime of success has led her to extensive opportunities to give back to and serve her community including work with children’s hospitals, schools, young entrepreneurs, and women in leadership. A few of the organizations she serves include the Women’s Leadership Network Advisory Board (Otterbein University), the Women's Business Enterprise Council Ohio River Valley (WBEC ORV), the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, The Wellington School, the National Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO), and the Women Presidents’ Organization (WPO). 

★    ★    ★ 

Sally was an appointed member of Attorney General Mike DeWine’s Ohio Consumers’ Counsel, and she served as the Women’s Small Business Accelerator Board’s (WSBA) 2019 Gala Chairperson, raising more money and attracting more attendees than ever before in an effort to bring awareness to this relatively new program for women. In 2016, she was honored as the Ohio Small Business Person of the Year, and twice she has been recognized as an Honoree for the Columbus Smart 50 Award.

He's one of 4 brothers.  His father Wolfgang Joseph Weber Sr. is a retired Mechanical Engineer, and his mother Catherine, worked as a stay at home mother.  Between 2004–2008, Wolfgang’s first TV appearance was on the CTV Canadian mini series “H2O” and soon after he moved to Florida in pursuit of his acting career.  While there he had booked small forgettable roles in a variety of commercials, shorts films and features.  However, his run of luck led him to second guess his acting career and embark on a career in law enforcement. 
 
After being denied time off for an audition, he decided to quit his job and go full force into acting by moving to Los Angeles, California leaving his law enforcement career behind.  For the first seven months he stayed in a hostel in South Los Angeles, and had lied to his parents about his living situation to not worry them.  It was only a few days and Wolfgang had signed with a manager.  From there he landed co star roles on various shows such as Cartoon Networks “Incredible Crew” & “CSI Miami”. Wolfgang was finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel by being cast in the thriller “Into the Darkness” starring alongside Twilights Kiowa Gordon, but do to financing issues, the film never got made after a years worth of press.  Although the film was never made, Wolfgang and some of the cast memebers did end up working together on the film “Heatwave”. Since then Wolfgang has starred in many indie films like “All American Zombie Drugs”,  “The Magicians Son”, “Resurgent” and can be seen on a variety of hit YouTube Channels, including his own.  You can also catch him in the features “Cynthia”, “Interpreters” and Lifetime's ""Devious Nanny"" all premiering in 2017.","APHoUC94R8eaZDpiOnTeUw==",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Starting with my work at the Max-Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition I have been specialising in media and technology law for many years and have focused on this area of law ever since. As head of Heussen Law´s IT, IP and Telecommunications Practice Group I advise companies on all aspects of commercial law. I primarily deal with issues of production, distribution and marketing of intellectual property rights and related technical products including meassures of protecting intellectual and industrial property rights. I have extensive experience in the sectors of film and television, publishing, music, software and advertising as well as mobile and online-media. As a former member of the German national field hockey team and author of the book ""Die Fernsehrechte des Sportveranstalters"" (""The Television Rights of Promoters of Sports Events"") I also cover legal aspects of marketing, particularly for sports events.","C08JE+nqSOWyQvSZ0ALAAQ==",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently working as a CX specialist at Naked I am learning daily and working on problem solving in regards to speaking to customers on the phone, dealing with support emails and handling claims from inception to completion.","M9WpqzHCSUWcTcHGroAxGw==",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the level of scholarship has to be considerably higher than that required for a research doctoral (PhD) thesis in terms of quality and quantity, and must be accomplished independently, in contrast with a PhD dissertation typically directed or guided by a faculty supervisor.

We ask how (spoken) language is used to understand the brain, and how the brain is used to understand (spoken) language. Using the full arsenal of modern neuroimaging approaches, we have investigated how right and left hemispheres contribute to decoding and understanding spoken utterances. In particular, we are interested in the influences of different forms of hearing loss and brain atrophy on the neuroplasticity of speech comprehension in different languages. Currently, we are working on a model of the evolutionary properties and origins of prosody and speech rhythm and their links to neural circuits of the motor system and aim to fathom the neural underpinning of structure planning during language production. Another area of our research examines the basis and treatment options for central hearing disorders, particularly chronic subjective tinnitus and its limiting effect on speech understanding and everyday communication.","8bQQ9T5uQ8GxHGGHKsJhcA==",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I believe that an energy-aware perspective is imperative for developing true artificial intelligence and that an AI-first approach is imperative for solving the challenge of transitioning to a sustainable future based on renewable energy. My research is organized under two broad themes: (1) Energy in Artificial Intelligence (the use of energy in developing AI). This area encapsulates research on the tradeoffs and limitations of energy usage in solving basic AI tasks such as classification, ranking or planning & search. The notion of what constitutes AI in a machine is most famously captured by the notion of the Turing test. Currently, this is an unfair test because AI systems that offer impressive performance on tasks in restricted domains (e.g., AlphaGo) are not judged fairly: while the human brain uses around 20W-25W of energy to perform such feasts, current AI methods use orders more energy today. Energy-efficient AI methods will also be required in the years to come to reduce their energy footprint in edge and cloud computing scenarios. (2) Artificial Intelligence in Energy (the use of AI technology in generating, storing and managing energy). This area encapsulates research into the development and application of state-of-the-art AI methods to particular problems arising from the larger reliance on renewable energy, starting with more refined modeling of batteries to enable the extension of their working lifetime, all the way to the development of AI methods for control of domestic energy consumption, necessitating research into computational privacy and explainable AI.","Potsdam, Brandenburg, Germany",,,"4","2022","Professor","false","urn:li:fsd_company:26179862","50","11","urn:li:fs_miniCompany:26179862","Renewables & Environment","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E0BAQGIIlqdkD-7pQ/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1662473855970/betteries_logo?e=1746662400&v=beta&t=kHNBQj_mlmOVOhAI9vphXhM-oJFXISwxXnzYp2mbloQ","betteries AMPS GmbH","urn:li:company:26179862","false","TOgMBAl4TBCJg9iM2ObT/A==","betteries","betteries AMPS GmbH","betteries is a profit for impact start-up based in Berlin, Germany that up-cycles batteries from electric vehicles (EV) into connected affordable power systems to avert climate change and protect valuable resources - fully embracing the principles of a circular economy.

I particularly enjoy the application of principled research to large-scale real-world problems. I enjoy learning new things every day and getting to work with (new) people. 

I fundamentally believe in a people-first approach: As a scientist, I want to solve problems that people really have - also called ""working backwards"" and ""customer-obsession""; as a manager, I always put people (development) over project (success) - the former being ""the end"" and the latter being ""the means"" (not the other way around); as a scientific leader, I always prefer to discuss ideas with another scientist over just reading their work - learning happens faster and in a more sustained way in a dialog rather than in reading.

I do not accept existing scientific boundaries and think that the largest breakthroughs will be made at the intersection of existing disciplines. My research interests include Bayesian inference and decision making, game theory, information retrieval, natural language processing, computer vision, distributed systems, learning theory and knowledge representation and reasoning. I have published over 80 peer reviewed conference and journal papers in these fields. 

I am one of the inventors of the Drivatars™ system in the Forza Motorsport series as well as the TrueSkill™ ranking and matchmaking system in Xbox 360 Live. I also co-invented the click-prediction technology used in bing's online advertising system (adPredictor) which is used widely in the industry now. I am co-inventor for several patents relating to these inventions.","Le4POa06Qvq4EuvxCfAUVQ==",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In my client and internal R&D projects, I build those systems (PoCs, demos, and in production), and give seminars and trainings about prompt engineering for ChatGPT, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and other closed- and open-source models. Starting my life as a Northern German countryside boy from a non-academic background, my journey has taken many improbable paths*. There are still many things I’d like to do, but if none of them came true, that would also be okay. 

Some of my guiding principles:
• life and the universe have no intrinsic goal – what we call purpose or meaningful are the things we value, and that's all that's needed        (to make their pursuit worthwhile and life beautiful)
• people first        (or the ultimate goal should be the flourishing of sentient beings)
• don't treat others like you wouldn't want to be treated (silver rule), treat others like you would like to be treated (golden), treat others like they would like to be treated (diamond)
• freedom, equality, and justice       (everyone should get a fair chance to flourish in their way)
• everything is transient        (and one primary cause for suffering is non-acceptance of this reality through craving and aversion)
• our selves are made up of multiple selves (recognition of this fact allows us to integrate our conflicting parts)
• judge an action by its consequences in context (don't get stuck on principles)
• done is better than perfect        (good enough is better than not done)

Making the world a better place is a noble but difficult goal. In my view, Effective Altruism (EA) is one of the better ways to care about global priority topics and the long-term future before we run out of time to find infinity.

My hobbies past and present include fine arts, photography, guitar, reading, juggling, jogging, linguistics, Ultimate Frisbee, swimming, cycling, triathlons, yoga, Lindy Hop dancing, and Vipassana meditation.

🧊 Currently, I am the Operations Manager at Chill Steel Pipes and Founder and CEO of CashBox Media. I sold my first company BUZZBOXX by NEKKTAR after 5.5 years as founder and remain a minority owner.

🍃 I am committed to rethinking the cannabis industry through socially aware entrepreneurship. After suffering 4 severe concussions in high school, cannabis single-handedly helped me recover from post-concussion syndrome and I was introduced to the benefits of microdosing cannabis daily. I will forever advocate for the plant that helped me, and so many others.

📚 I studied Public Policy at Duke University and I deeply love the state of North Carolina, specifically the Raleigh-Durham area.

😈 I grew up an athlete and have been drawn to almost every sport on the planet; catch me watching the best of Women and Men’s basketball, tennis, volleyball, baseball, softball, racing, swimming -- you name it, and I will be watching it.

👟 The freshest pair of sneakers in my closet are the Jordan 3 Retro in Rust Pink. 

💭 Embracing the humility of always being on a financial literacy journey — whether in entrepreneurship or personal finance.

💃🏽 Dancing through life with the energy of Gen Z and the heart of an old soul.


📧 If ANYTHING on my profile caught your eye, reach out me — I’d love to talk. Through my experiences, I hope to show that we can bring our true selves to work and thrive.

My journey has been a continuous exploration of technology. With a Bachelor's Degree in International Business that I pursued with a dual program studies at Adobe, a pivotal moment in my career was when I made the shift at Microsoft from a Partner Business Development role to a technical Pre-Sales role for AI as part of an internal pilot for young professionals.

My mission:
I wanted to take things a step further with a Dual Degree in Madrid: an International MBA & Master's Degree in Big Data & Analytics. This journey got me hands-on experience in data preparation and exploratory analysis, programming in Python and R, building machine learning models, performing Spark analysis, and creating recommendation engines and computer vision systems. These acquired skills now empower me to better understand and address the everyday challenges faced by my customers.

My vision: 
My aspiration is to make technology more understandable and accessible to people, helping them realize its potential to revolutionize every industry. In my point of view, there still is a disconnect between business departments and IT, and my goal is to bridge this gap, unlocking the untapped opportunities that lie ahead.","svvJ9nX1SOu1XUrhh4U6VA==","SCIENCE_AND_TECHNOLOGY","TUM.ai","Mentoring overview page: https://tum-ai.notion.site/TUM-ai-Mentoring-Program-ceec18a428e841c3b3408100457f6131","Mentor","6","2022","6","2022","ECONOMIC_EMPOWERMENT","Microsoft",,"SkillHer Mentorin","4","2021","4","2021","EDUCATION","ReDI School of Digital Integration","within Microsoft, we support evening classes held by internal experts about digital topics to refugees already having academic background in technology.","Organisator and Instructor",,"2019","10","2017"

In the early 2000s, my work on AI-based wireless device positioning (2000+ scientific citations) was commercialized as the spinoff company Ekahau Inc. This led to a successful $100+ million exit (acquired by Ookla/Ziff Davis). 

My Elements of AI online course for non-experts (co-created with MinnaLearn) has been rated as the world's best computer science MOOC on Class Central. The course has over 1.4 million participants.

I serve on program committees of major international machine learning conferences including NeurIPS (area chair), ICML, and UAI. I have published over 65 peer reviewed scientific articles, and hold two international patents. I have given invited talks at, e.g., Google, Apple, Microsoft Research, Stanford University, Yale, Purdue, Sorbonne, the European Parliament, Club de Madrid, OECD, and UNESCO. 

Together with my research group at the University of Helsinki and collaborators, we develop new machine learning methods for a wide range of application areas such as cancer epidemiology, neuroscience, and astrophysics. I'm also actively engaged with developing AI education for schools.

Netflix provides a path to do this by helping you watch fantastic shows whenever you want and as often as you want. Just look at the array of “Netflix Originals” we released in recent years.

But how does this happen? How did we become the premier destination to win that “moment of truth” when you decide to watch Netflix rather than doing something else with your time?

The team I’m a part of believes content creators should be focused on creating that moment, and not the bureaucracy of managing a studio. We believe in using engineering  to help them tell their stories. If we succeed, better content will be created and we will produce more Stranger Things & House of Cards. We intend to bring more joy and awareness to the world through creators.

We believe we will build the world’s most technologically advanced studio.

- AI Data: from human data annotation for pre and post-training to model and data lineage for GenAI data governance and RAI
- AI Model activation: tools and processes for model pre-training, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, orchestration, and model serving at scale. While we mostly focus on Gemini, we also support many other workstreams for models like Imagen, Veo, or Gemma. In fact, we also support non GenAI models internally.
- AI Frameworks: My team manages internal and external roadmap and strategy for frameworks like JAX, Keras, TensorFlow, or XLA. This also includes AI for mobile platforms now presented under the umbrella of Google AI Edge
- Compute infrastructure and efficiency: We own much of the internal AI Compute infrastructure and build efficiency tools to make sure we can bring the best out of our hardware and data centers.
- AI capacity planning and tools: Similarly, we model and plan capacity needs for all our Google needs across TPUs, GPUs, and standard compute.

I am fascinated by the innovative possibilities of digital technologies, and how they can be implemented quickly and successfully through Ecosystems. 

For the past 10 plus years, I’ve been particularly involved with the topic of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning , how it gives rise to innovative solutions and the strategic importance of collaboration, strategic partnerships and ecosystems .

Current activities
With the AI.FUND (https://ai-fund.vc/) we invest in European AI startups.
I am the Managing Director of KI-Allianz Baden-Württemberg eG (https://ki-allianz.de/), which aims to establish a centre and ecosystem for AI in the state that is competitive and visible throughout Europe and internationally.
With ADI Innovation (https://www.adi.de/) and IBHO Management (https://ibho.de/) , I advise enterprises, startups and the public sector on the implementation of digital transformation and applications of AI.

In 2020 I have been nominated by the German government as an Member of the Global Partnership on AI (https://gpai.ai/), where I advance the topics of innovation & commercialization of AI with experts from 20 countries.
Since 2020 I support the German Federal Agency for disruptive Innovations (https://www.sprind.org/en/) as an expert for AI
Since 2018 I support the German Government in the development of the German AI Strategy.

Past activities:

Through AI.Hamburg I promoted the transfer and use of AI in companies in Hamburg and Northern Germany. Together with other AI initiatives, we founded AI4Germany to foster collaboration and bring Germany into the AI age.
At appliedAI / UnternehmerTUM, I expanded the AI Ecosystem in Germany and Europe.
I supported the Tübingen AI Competence Center and the Cyber Valley Initiative as General Manager with a focus on the transfer of AI from science into business.
At IBM, I helped to roll out the topic of AI and Watson Health in Europe.
For almost 20 years, I held various management positions at SAP. I introduced new technologies to the market (ERP R/3), built up the global partnership with Microsoft, helped initiate the global technology partner program, was responsible for the product portfolio in the public sector and built up strategic risk management (today Foresight) for the Executive Board.","AOIXUAYZRxioBHVp/80Apw==",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Viele Menschen leben unter ihrem Potenzial und können so viel mehr aus ihrem (eventuell) einzigen Leben machen, als sie es tun. Das finde ich sehr traurig und das Schlimmste für mich daran ist, dass die Gründe dafür meistens unbegründete Ängste oder gesellschaftliche Normen sind.

Diese Erkenntnis und der damit verbundene Schlüsselmoment in meinem Leben hat mich offen gesprochen nachhaltig geprägt. Ich habe mir daraufhin fest zum Ziel gemacht, nichts im Leben jemals zu bereuen, stets zu versuchen, alles aus dem einen Leben zu machen, was ich mir erträume und anderen zu helfen, das Gleiche tun zu können.

In der Uni versuchten mir Dozenten zu erklären, dass ich einen klassischen Weg gehen müsse, um erfolgreich zu werden. Ich habe die Uni nach einem halben Semester geschmissen und gründete mein erstes Unternehmen mit meinem damals ganzen Ersparten (3.000€). Vielleicht auch, um der Welt zu beweisen, dass es vielleicht doch anders geht, als es im Lehrbuch steht.

Auch wenn eine erfolgreiche Firma aufzubauen, dann doch nicht so einfach war, wie im jugendlichen Leichtsinn gedacht, durfte ich schnell dazu lernen und war mit 21 Jahren bereits Gastdozent in meiner damaligen Uni, um darüber zu sprechen, wie man als junger Mensch erfolgreich wird. Das hat mir erstmal eine gute Portion Selbstbewusstsein gegeben, auf die ich aufbauen konnte :-P

Aus dem kleinen Unternehmen wurde ein größeres Unternehmen und darauf folgten 5 weitere Unternehmen. Wir wurden zu einer Unternehmensgruppe, die mittlerweile über 350 Metaverse bezogene Projekte für Fortune 500/100 und den Mittelstand umgesetzt hat. Doch warum erzähle ich das?

Ich möchte eine Welt, in der jeder Mensch sein volles Potenzial auslebt, um damit sein eigenes Leben und das seiner Mitmenschen zu bereichern. Ich möchte, dass Menschen sehen, dass man mit 3.000 Euro und ohne Investor gründen kann und einige Jahre später mit einem Alter von 27 Jahren daraus achtstellige Unternehmensbewertungen resultieren können, wenn man an sich glaubt und bereit ist, die notwendige Energie zu investieren.

Aber ob man Unternehmer/in oder was ganz anderes werden will, ist mir dabei ziemlich egal.

Ich möchte einfach Leuten ersparen, mit 70 zu realisieren, dass man sein Leben und sein Potenzial aufgrund von schwachsinnigen gesellschaftlichen Normen nicht ausgelebt hat.

Unser Ziel ist es nun auch über Social Media unsere Reise zu teilen, um damit hoffentlich Mut zu machen, die eigene Lebensvision umzusetzen oder eben zu inspirieren, sie zu finden.","QRnnJ6rIREaD+IPsQ/RNAA==",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Matures, It May Call Jürgen Schmidhuber 'Dad'."" Since age 15, his main goal has been to build a self-improving A.I. smarter than himself, then retire. His lab's deep learning artificial neural networks based on ideas published in the ""Annus Mirabilis"" 1990-1991 have revolutionised machine learning and A.I. By 2017, they were on over 3 billion smartphones, and used billions of times per day, for Facebook’s automatic translation, Google’s speech recognition, Google Translate, Apple’s Siri & QuickType, Amazon’s Alexa, etc. Generative AI is also based on his work: he introduced artificial curiosity & generative adversarial networks (1990, now widely used), self-supervised pre-training for deep learning (1991, the ""P"" in ""ChatGPT"" stands for ""pre-trained""), unnormalised linear Transformers (1991, the ""T"" in ""ChatGPT"" stands for ""Transformer""), and meta-learning machines that learn to learn (since 1987, now widely used). His lab also produced LSTM, the most cited AI of the 20th century, and the LSTM-inspired Highway Net, the first very deep feedforward net with hundreds of layers (ResNet, the most cited AI of the 21st century, is an open-gated Highway Net). In 2006-2010, he published the ""formal theory of fun and creativity."" Elon Musk tweeted: ""Schmidhuber invented everything."" He is recipient of numerous awards, Co-Chair of the KAUST Gen AI Center in KSA, Scientific Director of the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA, and co-founder & former President of NNAISENSE. He is a frequent keynote speaker at major events, and advising various governments on A.I. strategies.

Long years of design-led business experience, from front-line team lead at IDEO to CEO of Adaptive Path, give the ability to unlock unrealized potential in creative teams, the insight to find unexpected opportunities in new products and new markets that out-maneuver the competition, and the confidence of having led whole companies to execute with that creative focus.

Personal appearances at events such as TEDx and SXSW, and publications and blogs such as Fast Company, have fostered the presence to express thought leadership on a national stage and to position an organization as a leader in its field.

A broad range of operational experience, from military command as a Naval Officer to General Manager at frogdesign, in the US, Italy, the Netherlands, and England, provide an extensive and varied set of management and leadership tools, along with a fine understanding of which approach will inspire and support the best performance from an organization in a particular context, gained by having been there and done that.

Leading and living change, from weathering the worst recession since the great depression in a high-performing and resource-constrained firm, to expanding a single studio into multiple studios around the world, to consolidating physical and digital design groups in order to elevate their work to the cutting edge of value, have taught me how to lead a company to thrive, rather than merely survive, in the only thing that is constant - change.
